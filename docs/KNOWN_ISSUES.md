## ProfileSheet GuestAvatar bleeds behind BottomNavigation

**Found during:** Community Phase 1 evidence review (2026-07-04).

**Symptom:** When `ProfileSheet` is closed, its `GuestAvatar` illustration can
visually bleed through `BottomNavigation`'s translucent, blurred background,
appearing as a faint circular shape behind the rightmost nav tab.

**Root cause (verified via DOM/computed-style inspection, not guessed):**
`ProfileSheet.tsx` positions itself with `position: fixed; bottom: 80px` and
hides via `transform: translateY(100%)` — `100%` of its own height, not the
viewport. On builds where the sheet's rendered height is large enough, the
"closed" top edge lands only a few pixels above `BottomNavigation`'s `<nav>`
top edge, and since that nav has a ~6%-opacity background with a blur filter
rather than a solid one, the sheet's top content (including `GuestAvatar`)
shows through softly instead of being fully hidden.

**Confirmed NOT Community-specific:** identical `GuestAvatar` bounding-box
coordinates appear on both `/community-preview` and the real `/home` route.
`CommunityPreviewView` mounts `ProfileSheet` with the exact same `open`/
`onClose` pattern `HomeView.tsx` already uses — this is pre-existing,
`ProfileSheet`-rooted, not introduced by any Community code. It's simply
easier to notice on `/community-preview` because no nav tab is active there,
so there's no competing bright cyan active-tab glow overlapping the same
spot to mask it (which is what happens on `/home`).

**Status:** Deferred. Not fixed as part of Community work. Suspected fix
scope (not yet approved or attempted): `ProfileSheet.tsx`'s closed-position
transform math — out of scope for whoever picks this up until scoped and
approved on its own, separate from any feature branch.
